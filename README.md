# Advent of Code 2023 in Common Lisp

I'm using the Advent of Code 2023 to exercise my Common Lisp muscles.

Learnings
---------

Learnings from prior years: [2022](https://github.com/atgreen/advent-of-code-2022/blob/main/README.md) [2021](https://github.com/atgreen/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/README.md) [2020](https://github.com/atgreen/advent-of-code-2020/blob/main/README.md)

I'm using [ocicl](https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl) for dependency management this year instead of quicklisp.  Just run `ocicl install` to install the libraries I'm using.

Here are some of my personal learnings from 2023.
